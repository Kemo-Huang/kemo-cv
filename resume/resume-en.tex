\begin{experiences}
  \experience%
    {Present}%
    {3D Vehicle Tracking}%
    [Improved the robustness of the algorithm by fusing camera and LiDAR data with attention mechanism for tracking 3D vehicles. Devised a tracking-by-detection pipeline with image-and-point appearance model and 3D motion model, which are trained by deep neural networks and long-short term memory respectively.]

  \experience%
    {Oct. 2019}%
    {3D Vehicle Detection}%
    [Built an online 3D vehicle detection system for monocular cameras and a single LiDAR. Integrated the detection algorithm with the "Autoware" software for autonomous driving system based on robot operating system (ROS) on Linux. It's an internship project of Shenzhen Haylion Tech.]

  \experience%
    {May 2019}%
    {Sensor Calibration}%
    [Experimented extrinsic calibration between monocular cameras and LiDARs. The 2D-3D point correspondences are trained with neural networks and the extrinsic parameters are solved efficently by perspective-n-point (PnP) methods with RANSAC optimization.]

  \experience%
    {Oct. 2018}%
    {LiDAR Point Cloud Upsampling}%
    [Assessed and optimized an image processing pipeline for depth image super-resolution. The depth from point clouds are completed by filter dilation and Markov random fields with fast speed and relatively low loss against ground truth of Kitti.]
